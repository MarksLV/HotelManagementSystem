# Hotel Management System
This is Hotel Management System created with JavaFX, this includes working GUI and using MySQL Workbench creating working database. This project was made within eclipse.

## How do you setup THE DATABASE!
In the project there is folder provided **database_dump** where is all the code needed to create database **hotelmanagement**, all the code for the tables have already been set within IT and all they need to be is executed creating needed tables, there are already few examples set within with few users, admins, etc. to demonstrate database connection system between program, *the examples can be removed if wished to do so*. After executing all the database dump code and having project setup correctly in the way that it opens, next thing to do is setup connection between program and database. To do that, you will need to edit file named **DBConnection.java** changing username and password according to your username and password used in MySQL Workbench.
